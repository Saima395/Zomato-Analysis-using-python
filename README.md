# Zomato-Analysis-using-python

This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data using Python to uncover insights into customer preferences and restaurant performance. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and formatting rating fields for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize restaurant types, rating distributions, voting patterns, online vs offline ordering behavior, and cost-related trends. Statistical measures such as average ratings and votes were calculated to identify top-performing and popular restaurants.

The analysis provides actionable insights into how factors like restaurant type, online ordering availability, pricing, and customer engagement influence ratings and popularity, making it useful for understanding market trends and customer behavior in the food service industry.
